# Decisions

Lightweight ADR log. Each entry: what we decided, why, what we rejected.

## D1 — MVP slice: ingest + verify vertical (2026-07-03)

First milestone: point at a directory (zips/raw files), stream into CAS,
match against a couple of loaded dats, report have/missing/unknown. No
output transforms yet. Proves the storage + hashing + dat-matching spine.
*Rejected:* storage-library-first (too long without something usable),
dat-pipeline-first, thin-full-vertical (breadth risk).

## D2 — Native CAS address: blake3 (2026-07-03)

blake3 is the single storage key for all objects. Dat hashes
(crc32/md5/sha1/sha256) are indexed aliases computed at ingest, never keys.
Why: tree hash → verified streaming + verified range reads (bao); iroh-blobs
alignment for free; fastest available. *Rejected:* sha256 (no verified
streaming, no p2p alignment), multihash (unused agility, fragments dedupe).

## D3 — Chunking lives in the recipe layer, not the base store (2026-07-03)

Base store holds whole blobs only. Chunked/dedup'd representations are
recipes (`concat(chunks…)`), with the chunker identity content-addressed and
pinned per-recipe. Why: dats verify whole files (natural unit); keeps base
store invariants trivial; chunking policy stays evolvable; iroh/dat
interop needs whole-file hashes as identity. *Rejected:* restic/casync-style
chunk-tree base store (freezes chunk policy into storage format, reassembly
on every read); dual-notion hybrid as a *storage* concept (bao's 16 KiB tree
is a transfer/verify detail, not dedupe).

## D4 — Recipe verification: verify on ingest, trust after (2026-07-03)

Locally-created claims are verified at creation (hashing is a byproduct of
ingest). Peer claims are lazily verified (on first materialize or background
scrub); completeness reporting distinguishes have(verified) from
have(claimed). Rationale: content-addressing means recipes can't corrupt
data, only waste CPU — so eager global verification buys little.
*Rejected:* always-verify-on-materialize as mandatory (fine as a cheap
default for streamed reads, but not required by integrity), heavyweight
tiered trust machinery (the verified/unverified distinction already covers
it).

## D5 — Storage recipes are deterministically replayable, forever (2026-07-03)

Any recipe used for residency (i.e. that permits dropping literal bytes) or
shared p2p must replay bit-exact across versions and architectures: exact
wasm component pinned by hash, deterministic wasmtime config (NaN
canonicalization, no threads, no clock/random/fs imports for pure
transforms). Why: "drop the literal, keep the recipe" is the storage
thesis; it's unsound without replay. *Rejected:* verified-at-creation-only
semantics (would demote recipes to provenance records and forbid residency
dropping).

## D6 — Native fast-paths; wasm for semantics (2026-07-03)

blake3/alias hashing, bao, and baseline zstd are native daemon code. All
format-aware transforms and all peer-supplied code are wasm. Why: wasm is
~1.5–2.5× native — irrelevant for the long tail, wasteful for bytes-level
hot paths that run on every object; peer code never runs native.

## D7 — Own WIT world, wasip2 now, wasip3 streams later (2026-07-03)

ABI is `datboi:transform@1.x`, a WIT world we own. Implemented via chunked
pull/push streaming on wasip2 today; WASI 0.3 native `stream<u8>` is
adopted later as an internal migration (our world, not a format break).
Nothing in the ABI may assume whole-blob buffering. *Rejected:* betting on
wasip3 immediately (rustc target still tier 3), raw core-wasm C-style ABI
(loses typed interfaces + semver'd WIT packages). *Amended by
D41/D42 at the M1 freeze: `@1` is a whole-buffer profile (streaming —
wasip2-chunked or wasip3-native — becomes the future `@2` world), and the
build target is wasm32-unknown-unknown, not wasip2.*

## D8 — P2P trust sequencing: friends first, ZKP later (2026-07-03)

v1 p2p is friends-tenancy: NodeId ACLs + instance-signed
`(dat_hash → blake3)` mapping tables. waddup-style ZK proofs
(sha256↔blake3 binding) are the later upgrade enabling trustless public
swarms; same mechanism slot can eventually cover recipe claims.

## D9 — Adopt community metadata artifacts; rar is ingest-only (2026-07-03)

clrmamepro header-skipper XMLs and retool clonelists are consumed as
first-class inputs (interpreter for skippers; clonelists augment
parent/clone). Source dats are never mutated; filtering happens at
query/output time. rar: extract-only (license — no free compressor);
never an output format.

## D10 — Metadata DB: SQLite (2026-07-03)

Embedded, zero-ops, WAL, single-writer daemon fit, ad-hoc SQL for
reporting/completeness math. *Rejected:* Postgres (external service
contradicts single-binary homelab model; p2p — not a shared DB — is the
multi-instance story), pure KV (loses queryability). No premature
repository-trait abstraction for a hypothetical Postgres.

## D11 — MAME from day one (2026-07-03)

Arcade MAME dats are in the MVP scope, not deferred. Rationale (user call):
MAME is the hardest case (parent/romof/device_ref closure, bios sets, CHD
disk claims, merge modes, monthly churn) — exercising it immediately keeps
the schema honest; deferring it risks a model that quietly can't absorb it.
Amends D1: the ingest+verify vertical includes MAME set auditing alongside
No-Intro/Redump. Merge-mode *rendering* (split/merged/non-merged output
layouts) remains output-transform work.

## D12 — Console keys are CAS assets (2026-07-03)

Keys (prod.keys, boot9, WiiU common key, …) are ordinary content-addressed
blobs, referenced by decrypt/encrypt recipes as inputs:
`apply(decrypt, args, [encrypted_blob, keys_blob])`. Determinism and
provenance hold with no special-case key machinery; sharing keys with
friends is just blob ACLs. We never *distribute* keys with the software.
Flagged for the future public-swarm mode: a "sensitive" blob marking so
keys aren't advertised to strangers by default.

## D13 — Every dat kind, losslessly; software lists day-one (2026-07-03)

The schema accommodates all dat families from the start: Logiqx XML,
clrmamepro text, RomCenter (import-only), MAME listxml, and MAME software
lists with their full part/dataarea/loadflag structure modeled (attrs-map
escape hatch for the long tail), plus No-Intro P/C extensions. *Rejected:*
flattening software lists to plain rom lists (audits would work but
rebuild fidelity for merged/softlist flows would be lost, contradicting
the losslessness principle).

## D14 — Own literal store from day one (2026-07-03)

We implement our own on-disk store; iroh-blobs is the p2p layer only (our
store will speak its irpc store protocol when p2p lands, keeping their
provider/downloader on top). Why (user call, backed by R5): the at-rest
format is decades-scale and must be a commitment — iroh-blobs is 0.x with
a history of no-migration rewrites (0.90); no dir sharding; and
inline-blobs-inside-redb directly contradicts the rebuildability doctrine
(bytes must live on the NAS, DBs are disposable caches). Cost controlled
by staging: MVP = complete-blobs-only + bao outboard sidecars; partial
bitfields + irpc facade arrive with p2p. *Rejected:* FsStore-as-scaffolding
(double format migration), all-custom p2p protocol (never — bao/iroh
downloader ecosystem is the p2p value).

## D15 — Rebuildability doctrine (2026-07-03)

Embedded DBs (SQLite + any KV) live on daemon-local disk and are pure
caches. NAS holds authoritative bytes; small authoritative state
(tags/pins, users, ACLs, config, dat-revision typing, alias table) is
periodically snapshotted into CAS as a signed structured object. Recovery
from bare NAS: scan → sniff structured objects → latest snapshot →
deterministic dat re-import. Server identity keypair is the single
non-CAS secret. Corollary: no feature may keep sole truth in a local DB.
*Rejected:* DBs-on-NFS (embedded-DB locking/fsync dragons), authoritative
SQLite with conventional backups (host stops being disposable).

## D16 — No-Intro sourcing: manual drop + gentle fetcher (2026-07-03)

First-class manual daily-pack drop (file/watch-dir/upload) plus a polite
opt-in fetcher (backoff, conditional requests) that degrades to asking for
a manual drop when challenged. Redump/MAME/libretro/retool auto-fetch
normally. *Rejected:* scraping past CAPTCHAs (etiquette/bans), bundling
third-party mirrors as default trust.

## D17 — Web UI: Svelte (2026-07-03)

Matches the rof-gui vite + importNpmLock nix pattern; light runtime;
emulator-core embedding is framework-agnostic. *Rejected:* React (heavier,
diverges from existing tooling), Solid (ecosystem size).

## D18 — Blob typing: edges, not nodes (2026-07-03)

Raw data blobs are unwrapped; identity is exactly blake3(bytes) (dat
aliasing, iroh interop, dedupe all require it). A blob's meaning derives
from what references it. datboi structured objects (recipes, manifests,
snapshots) self-identify via magic+type+version at the head of their
canonical encoding — plain blobs to the store, sniffable during recovery;
the DB carries typing in normal operation. *Rejected:* git-style type
headers on everything (forks identity from real-world hashes), per-blob
metadata sidecars (inodes, drift).

## D19 — Store layout: loose files only (2026-07-03)

Every blob is a sharded hash-named file; no pack files. Why (user call):
maximum format boringness and tooling transparency (rsync, ls, ZFS-native)
outweighs inode/metadata cost; hot paths never list directories (local
index), and packing can be retrofitted behind the trait as a pure
optimization later since identities never change. Accepted cost: ~10M
small files at full MAME scale → slow NFS metadata scans (parallelize;
deep fanout). *Rejected:* append-only packs for small blobs (compaction
complexity, less transparent), everything-packed (range reads/partial
fetch complexity).

## D20 — Store namespaces: data/ vs meta/ (2026-07-03)

Opaque payloads under `data/`, datboi structured objects under `meta/`.
Placement convention only (identity and serving are namespace-blind);
magic bytes retained inside structured objects as defense in depth.
Why: recovery parses the small meta/ tree fully, then only hash-verifies
data/ — no content-sniffing millions of payload files. *Rejected:* single
namespace + sniffing (slow recovery), storing recipes only in the DB
(violates D15 — DB is a cache).

## D21 — Recipes are an OR-graph; grounded GC (2026-07-03)

Multiple recipes per output hash are first-class (index many-to-one;
per-recipe verification state; residency planner picks cheapest verified
route). GC computes reconstructibility as a fixpoint grounded in retained
literal bytes — mutually-inverse recipe pairs must never circularly
justify dropping both literals.

## D22 — Aliases: derived cache locally, signed claim objects when shared (2026-07-03)

Alias facts are recomputable, so locally they live as DB rows (snapshotted
for recovery speed only). Shared aliases are signed batched CAS objects
(the D8 mapping table); peer alias claims auto-verify at ingest (full hash
tuple recomputed anyway); trustless verification without bytes is the
waddup ZKP slot. *Rejected:* per-alias micro-blobs (40M+ tiny objects),
authoritative alias storage (it's a pure function of data).

## D23 — Policy layer: config + wasm components, no embedded scripting (2026-07-03)

Recipes contain zero policy; policies (ingest strategy, 1G1R selection,
view layout) are declarative config for the common case plus
`datboi:policy@1` wasm components for the rest, and they *emit* recipes.
*Rejected:* embedded lua/rhai/starlark (a second plugin system with a
second sandbox story that can do nothing wasm can't).

## D24 — Bit-exact rebuilds guaranteed only for canonical formats (2026-07-03)

TorrentZip/RVZSTD and formats we control: rebuild guaranteed by
construction. Wild containers: ingest attempts parameter discovery; on
failure the container stays literal (members still extracted/deduped, no
rebuild recipe minted). *Rejected:* chasing bit-exactness for every
compressor variant ever shipped (unbounded reverse-engineering tax; most
scene zips are already TorrentZip'd).

## D25 — Drop safety: local replay required; zero nondeterminism (2026-07-03)

Literal bytes of X may be dropped only after X's rebuild recipe has
successfully replayed **on this host** (verified-at-creation or
peer-verification is insufficient). The entire drop/evict mechanism must
be fully deterministic. Composes with the D27 opaque-eviction rule and the
D21 grounding fixpoint.

## D26 — Keys remain ordinary blobs, no special handling (2026-07-03)

Challenge raised (legal posture of default-shareable keys) and overruled
by user: datboi does nothing special with keys — no extraction features,
no distribution; they are content like any other blob under the same ACLs.
Public-swarm-era default-advertisement policy can be revisited when public
swarms exist.

## D27 — Residency: keep-both under high-water; seekability-aware eviction (2026-07-03)

Default policy per storage class: literals stay until a high-water mark,
then recipe-covered literals evict (LRU-ish, D21 grounding + D25 replay
rules). Additional rule: **never evict a literal whose cheapest verified
recipe is opaque (non-seekable) while any pinned view snapshot references
it** — eviction cost is reconstruction class, not just recency.
*Rejected:* eager-drop (reconstruction latency cliffs), never-drop
(no storage benefit).

## D28 — At-rest compression: ZFS-delegate locally, seekable zstd in S3/HTTP backends (2026-07-03)

NAS backend stores plain bytes (ZFS zstd below, scrubbed, format stays
boring). S3/HTTP backends apply backend-internal seekable zstd (framed
~256 KiB; frame index alongside; identity and .obao always over plain
bytes). Compression-as-recipe remains available where it wins
independently.

## D29 — dir2dat early (2026-07-03)

"Export collection as dat" ships early: cheap given the claims model,
forces losslessness honesty, and is the p2p library-advertisement
primitive (signed dat of holdings).

## D30 — Auth v1: invites + passwords (2026-07-03)

Admin-minted invite URLs → local accounts (argon2) + session cookies.
Passkeys/OIDC/proxy-header modes are later add-ons. Why: passkeys are
origin-brittle in homelab deployments (IP churn strands credentials);
passwords are understood by everyone. iroh NodeId remains the
daemon↔daemon plane.

## D31 — MAME MVP guardrail (2026-07-03)

MAME-in-MVP means: parse listxml + software lists, audit non-merged sets,
CHD data-sha1 claims. It does NOT mean merge-mode rendering,
device_ref-closure set building, or softlist rebuild fidelity — those are
schema-accommodated (D13) but implemented post-MVP. Tripwire: implementing
loadflag semantics before the first No-Intro audit works = milestone
failure.

## D32 — Serving is userspace-only, cross-platform (2026-07-03)

All serving surfaces run in userspace with no kernel-module dependencies:
in-process NFSv3 as primary mount, HTTP/WebDAV day one, FUSE optional
where present, SMB via sidecar Samba initially. A from-scratch read-only
memory-safe SMB1 server for retro clients (OPL/OG-Xbox) is an accepted
future workstream (narrow, well-documented op subset; safer than enabling
NT1 in Samba).

## D33 — Local serving surfaces auto-flip to new view snapshots (2026-07-03)

When a view re-evaluates (dat update, new ingest), local surfaces switch
atomically to the new snapshot; in-flight reads on the old snapshot stay
valid until quiesced (it remains pinned).

## D34 — P2P sharing: tickets + channels; holdings-first (2026-07-03)

Immutable shares are tickets to snapshot hashes (no refresh semantics).
Mutable shares are signed monotonic channels with pull-based subscribers
(subscriber-side residency policy: metadata-only | on-demand | mirror).
v1 ships holdings channels only (dir2dat inventory, auto-promoted);
curated channels (manual promotion) are a later feature. Peer
availability becomes a completeness state
(`available-from-peer(X)`). *Rejected:* push-based publication (peers own
their storage decisions), auto-promoting curated shares (propagates
curation mistakes into friends' pinned storage).

## D35 — MVP cutline ratified (2026-07-03)

MVP is additive-only (zero eviction; no byte-destroying code path),
CLI-only (localhost daemon, no auth/UI until M4), containers-stay-literal
with members-as-claims (≈1.0× storage), zero load-bearing wasm (builtins
only; wasmtime ships with reference transform + determinism CI gate).
Milestone order M2 (shrink) → M3 (views/serving) → M4 (UI/auth) →
M5 (p2p) → M6+ (frontier). Full definition in 90-roadmap.md. *Rejected:*
early storage wins in MVP (adds drop-adjacent paths to v1), status-page
scope leak, p2p-before-UI reordering.

## D40 — Ingest custody: copy default, move for bulk adoption, no by-reference blobs (2026-07-03)

`ingest --copy` is the default (source untouched); `--move` renames into
the store for collections already on the NAS dataset (zero data
movement, layout intentionally destroyed — loud docs). By-reference
storage is rejected: every blob-index row must be backed by bytes in
`data/` (rebuildability + no mutable-under-us files). The
try-before-custody use case is served by an audit-only mode
(`datboi audit --against <dir>`: hash, claim, report; store nothing but
the rescan cache).

## D36 — Aggregation ratified, lands M2 (2026-07-03)

Content-defined aggregation as designed: aggregate = plain blob = concat
of a complete game/machine's member set sorted by member blake3; members
become affine `assemble` slice recipes; both directions in the OR-graph;
boundary derives from dat revisions (instances converge — no pack-file
combinatorics); incomplete games stay loose; stale aggregates from
revision churn are re-aggregated lazily and GC'd. D19 store format
unchanged (aggregates are ordinary blobs). The M1 NFS benchmark decides
default-on vs opt-in.

## D37 — Two-file DB split (2026-07-03)

`state.db` (authoritative-until-snapshotted, tiny, synchronous=FULL,
real migrations) + `cache.db` (derivable, nukeable, cavalier
migrations). Makes D15 mechanically checkable: sole truth only in
state.db, which must round-trip the snapshot encoder. Accepted:
cross-file consistency is eventual. *Rejected:* single file (doctrine by
convention only).

## D38 — Revision materialization: current + previous (2026-07-03)

Full entry/claim rows for the current and previous revision per source;
older revisions demote to header-only (rows deleted, re-importable on
demand from the CAS dat blob). Bounded growth with out-of-the-box update
diffs. *Rejected:* current-only (every diff re-imports), keep-everything
(unbounded).

## D39 — 'Probable' is a distinct audit state (2026-07-03)

crc32+size-only matches report as `probable`, never folded into
have(claimed). Six states: have-verified / have-claimed / probable /
available-from-peer / missing / unknown. Same honesty principle as the
verified/claimed split; UIs may collapse visually.

## D41 — WIT world frozen at @1: whole-buffer profile (2026-07-06)

`datboi:transform@1.0.0` (transforms/wit/transform.wit) is frozen:
`describe(op) -> descriptor` + `run(op, params, inputs: list<list<u8>>)
-> result<list<list<u8>>, string>`. Whole-buffer by-value blobs; the
world imports NOTHING except its own `types` interface, so ambient
nondeterminism (clock/random/fs) is unrepresentable — the import surface
is the sandbox. Seekability (D27) rides along as `describe` metadata even
though @1 can't stream. A streaming profile is a deliberate future
`@2` world, not a revision: per D7 old worlds stay executable forever,
and which world a component targets is recipe metadata. The determinism
gate (crates/datboi-runtime/tests/determinism.rs) pins the committed
reference component by blake3 plus a golden output hash as the
cross-architecture anchor; updating the fixture is a format event.
*Rejected:* shipping streaming in @1 (host-backed stream resources drag
in wasi:io and its pollables — see D42 — and M1's bounded transforms
don't need it).

## D42 — Transforms build for wasm32-unknown-unknown, not wasip2 (2026-07-06)

Discovered by the determinism PoC before the freeze: Rust's
`wasm32-wasip2` std links WASI shims (wasi:io, wasi:cli, …) into every
component even when unused, so a "pure" transform demands ambient
imports the empty linker must refuse — the D5 contract and the target
were incompatible. Transforms therefore compile to core modules for
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` (std available, zero host imports; panics
become traps) and are componentized with `wasm-tools component new` (no
adapter). Enforced two ways: the runtime's linker is empty, and the gate
test instantiates a WASI-importing component and asserts refusal.
*Rejected:* linking deterministic WASI stubs (weakens
"unrepresentable" to "stubbed", and pulls wasmtime-wasi into the
minimal engine build).
